This is a toy data set of  paper《Training Algorithm for Perceptron with Multi-Pulse Type Activation Function》. 
This set is made aiming to show the effectiveness of our perceptron dealing with piecewise linearly separable problem. 
This data set consist of 1400 samples, including 600 positive samples and 800 negative samples.
Please cite this paper 《Training Algorithm for Perceptron with Multi-Pulse Type Activation Function》if it's useful for you.
